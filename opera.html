    <h3>Utopia Limited</h3>
    <h4>Act-2 Throne Room in the Palace.  Night.  Fitzbattleaxe
        discovered</h4>
    <p> Zara: 
        Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
        qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
        notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
        thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
        (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
        hand in his), you have that already!</p>  
    <p>Fitz.: 
        Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can
        trans-mute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.</p> 
    <p>King: 
        We take your word for it that this is all right.  You
        are not making fun of us?  This is in accordance with the prac-
        tice at the Court of St. James's?</p>
    <p>Lord D.: 
        Well, it is in accordance with the practice at the Court
        of St. James's Hall.</p> 
    <p>Chorus:   
        Divorce is nearly obsolete in England.</p>
    <p>Scaphio:  
        And as if that wasn't enough, the County Councillor has
        or-dered a four-foot wall to be built up right across the
        proscenium, in case of fire—as in England.</p> 
    <p>Phantis:  
        It's so hard on the company—who are liable to be
        roasted alive—and this has to be met by enormously increased
        salaries—as in England.</p>
