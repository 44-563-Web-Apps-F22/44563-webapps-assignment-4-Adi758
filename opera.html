        Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
        qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
        notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
        thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
        (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
        hand in his), you have that already!</p>

        And as if that wasn't enough, the County Councillor has
        or-dered a four-foot wall to be built up right across the
        proscenium, in case of fire—as in England.</p>

        It's so hard on the company—who are liable to be
